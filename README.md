# BINJ - Streaming Interface

**Author : [@RubnK](https://github.com/RubnK)**

This project is a Netflix-like streaming interface built with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. The application provides a complete user experience with authentication, movie/series search, and TMDB API integration.

The codebase utilizes modern web technologies:
- HTML5 for semantic structure
- CSS3 for styling and animations
- JavaScript ES6+ for functionality
- TMDB API for movie data
- YouTube API for trailers

**Live Demo**: [https://binj.rcorp.fr](https://binj.rcorp.fr)
